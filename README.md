# Tamagotchi Python Game

Project developed by **Alexandre Sintes** as part of the CT.1207 module at ISEP (Institut Supérieur de l'Électronique de Paris).

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate five Tamagotchis using Python with a graphical user interface (GUI) built in Tkinter.  
Each virtual pet has dynamic state variables and can be interacted with through the GUI.

## Main Features

- Simulation of five Tamagotchis in parallel
- State variables: hunger, health, boredom, fatigue, thirst
- Day/night cycle (3 minutes per day, 30 to 60 seconds sleep period)
- Graphical interface using Tkinter
- Save and load game state
- Help menu with game rules
- New action: drink
- Death condition if thirst reaches zero

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Dictionaries and lists for state management
- Object-oriented programming

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
